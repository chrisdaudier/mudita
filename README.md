# Mudita Studios - Daily Planner

Please create a simple web application that will work on web or mobile screens and automatically adjust for any size screen. The application should do the following:

Ask the user to provide the top things they want to accomplish today (e.g. go for a 20 minute run, mow the lawn, prepare for meeting with Jessica at work, help daughter with science project).

The application should show a simple progress bar or spinner while, in the background, it is using any simple LLM to optimally plan out the day for the user.

The output should then be a fun and simple visualization of what they should do, when, and ideally detail out why they should do things in this order.

For instance:

We think preparing for the Jessica meeting and helping your daughter with the science project are both tasks that can’t be skipped. We also assume since it’s a school day that daughter won’t be home until late afternoon. We also bundled the two outdoor activities together. As such, we recommend something like this:

- 11AM: Prepare for meeting with Jessica at work
- 1PM: Go for a 20 minute run
- 2PM: Mow the lawn
- 4PM: Help daughter with Science project
